I'm a third-year master's student from [School of EECS]([https://eecs.pku.edu.cn/](https://ssse.sysu.edu.cn/)), [Sun Yat-Sen University]([https://www.sysu.edu.cn/]). My research interest includes reinforcement learning, offline reinforcement learning and multi-agent reinforcement learning.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Huang Hanyan]([https://www.XXX.com/](https://ssse.sysu.edu.cn/teacher/138)), Sun Yat-Sen University. 

You can find my CV here: [Shen Yi's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf).
